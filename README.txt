Searchlight for Managing News
-----------------------------

This module provides Searchlight[1] integration for the Managing News install
profile[2]. There are no special instructions to install this module beyond
those for Managing News and Searchlight.

## TODO

* expose taxonomy terms as facets
* expose channels as facets
* proper handling of "deleted" content.
* use searchlight for the graphs
